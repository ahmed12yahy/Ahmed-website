            <p>In simple terms, robotics combines science, engineering, and technology to design, construct, operate,<br>
                 and use machines programmed to replicate, substitute, or assist humans in completing tasks of varying complexity.<br>
                  These machines are known as robots. <br>
                Robots have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece; notably, the first digital-operated and programmable<br> 
                robot debuted in the mid-twentieth century. Robotics quickly took over key industries like automotive manufacturing, <br>
                with early spot welding robot prototypes used in General Motors facilities in 1961. Throughout the years, <br>
                robotics has developed increasingly sophisticated machines to benefit a wide range of industries.<br><br><br>
                Today, robots are in use everywhere around the globe, from college clubs to Fortune 100s.<br> 
                Companies and individuals alike are harnessing the power<br>
                 of robotics more than ever before, with the value of the Global Robotics Market<br>

            <h2>1-Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)</h2>
            <p>
                Using sophisticated sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, <br>
                autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can support many tasks, including delivering items,<br>
                 carrying out safety and security checks, inventory automation, <br>
                rescue missions, crop harvesting, and even space exploration.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>2-Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)</h2>
            <p>
                As a form of autonomous mobile robots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs)<br>
                 are movable robots capable of navigating mapped routes via wires on a floor,<br>
                  radio waves, cameras, magnets, or lasers. These robots have several applications,<br>
                 including transporting heavy materials in factories and warehouses<br>
            </p>
            <h2>3-Articulated Robots </h2>
            <p>
                One of the main features of an articulated robot is rotary joints that can range from simple <br>
                two-jointed structures to complex systems of multiple interacting joints and materials. <br>
                The articulated robot is a typical type of industrial robot and often resembles a human arm.<br>

            <p>
                A humanoid robot resembles a generic human body form. The specialized design is typically used for <br>
                mimicking human motions and interactions. A common use case of humanoid robots <br>
                is automating tasks to increase efficiency and cost-savings.<br>

            <h2>5-Cobots</h2>
            <p>
                A cobot is a contracted term for a collaborative robot.<br>
                 These robots work side-by-side with human workers. <br>
                 They differ from other robots because their function is not intended to do work in place of human employees.<br>
                  Often they are compact and perform a variety <br>
                of tasks in the metal industry, automotive, electronics, laboratories, and hospitals<br>
